					<p>“enough for you” is the seventh track on Olivia Rodrigo’s 2021 album ‘Sour.’ 
						In the song, Olivia sings about trying to be the best version of herself just to please her man. 
						She went out of her way to be enough for him but all her efforts were not enough to keep him around.</p>
					<p>Olivia realizes that he is gone and there is no point crying over spilled milk. She only wants herself back. 
						The version of herself whom she loved and wanted to better herself. 
						Now she is a mere mess crying over some stupid boy.</p>

				<h3 class="text-left"><p>‘All I Want’ is an emotionally authentic song jotted down by Olivia Rodrigo. 
					The singer had written the song from the standpoint of a mythical personality she characterizes. 
					However, the justification of the song is she was able to write such a song in a very relatable way because of her real-life experiences. 
					On top of that, the issue is Olivia’s dissatisfaction with two of her ex-boyfriends. 
					Let’s learn the meaning behind the lyrics of the song ‘All I Want’ by Olivia Rodrigo.

					<p>In this song, Ashe talks about learnings from her relationships and it is okay to have your heartbroken. 
						The song bases around the idea that “it’s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.”.
					</p>
					<p>On the digital pre-save link for the song, Ashe gave her fans the inspiration behind this song; 
						“This time a year ago I was dreading the arrival of Valentine’s Day knowing my marriage was on the verge of collapse. 
						Months later than I should have, I moved out of my house, filed for divorce and left for tour. 
						Faced with a broken relationship and no immediate answers to as to why we failed, writing ‘Moral of the Story’ became my way of making sense of it all.”.</p>
